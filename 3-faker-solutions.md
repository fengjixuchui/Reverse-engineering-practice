#### Take from TUCTF

This past weekend I participated in TUCTF, I was finally able to utilize some of the basics reverse engineering skills I have studied over the past few weeks. This challenge is called "faker", and it can be solved with a very clean and simple patch that I personally used to get the flag for the CTF.
